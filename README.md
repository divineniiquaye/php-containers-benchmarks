PHP Container Benchmarking Suite
================================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/phpbench/benchmarks-containers.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/phpbench/benchmarks-containers)

This benchmarking suite compares PHP Dependency Injection Containers. Its sort
of an example project for [PHPBench](https://github.com/phpbench/phpbench).

It is intended to be a base for developing a standard benchmarking suite for
all of the PHP containers out there.

Including:

- [PHP-DI](https://github.com/PHP-DI/PHP-DI).
- [Symfony Dependency Injection](https://github.com/symfony/DependencyInjection).
- [Pimple](https://github.com/silexphp/Pimple).
- [PHPBench Container](https://github.com/phpbench/phpbench).
- [Illuminate (Laravel) Container](https://github.com/illuminate/container)
- [Php League Container](http://container.thephpleague.com/)
- [Laminas Service Manager](https://github.com/laminas/laminas-servicemanager)
- [Aura DI](https://github.com/auraphp/aura.di)
- [Rade DI](https://github.com/divineniiquaye/rade-di)
- [Nette DI](https://github.com/nette/di)

Note that PHPBench Container is not a "real" container, but a minimal
ad-hoc call-back based container used by PHPBench itself.

Disclaimer
----------

We take no responsiblity for the accuracy of these benchmarks. If you want to
be sure of the results please clone this repository, look at the code, and run
the benchmarks yourself.

If you are a container maintainer and you notice that the benchmarks are not
fair, then please make a pull request.

The benchmarks do not cover all contingencies, infact they are currently quite
limited. Please feel free to make pull requests as required.

Results
-------

- All containers are expected to be optimized except in the `unoptimized
  test`.

Subjects (all executed 1000 times):

- `GetOptimizedNode`: Return a shared service (expected cache effect).
- `GetUnoptimized`: Return a shared service without optimization (i.e. no
  dumping of the container, etc).
- `GetPrototype`: Return a new instance of the service.
- `Lifecycle`: Instantiate the container and return a shared service.
